Python is a programming language widely used by Data Scientists. It has some libraries with large collections of mathematical functions and analytical tools. In this tutorial, we will use the following libraries:

### Pandas:
This library is used for structured data operations, like importing CSV files, creating data frames, and data preparation
### Numpy:
It is a mathematical library with a powerful N-dimensional array object, linear algebra, the Fourier transform, and more.
### Matplotlib:
This library is used to visualize data.
### SciPy:
