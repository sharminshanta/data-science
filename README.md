### What is data science?
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge methods to extract meaningful insights and wisdom from data. It involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large amounts of structured and unstructured data to make informed decisions, predict future trends, and solve complex problems.

### What is data science used for?
Data science is used to study data in the following ways:
1. Descriptive Analysis
2. Diagnostic Analysis
3. Predictive Analysis
4. Prescriptive Analysis

# What do we need for Data Science in Python?
Python is a programming language widely used by Data Scientists. It has some libraries with large collections of mathematical functions and analytical tools. In this tutorial, we will use the following libraries:

### Pandas:
This library is used for structured data operations, like importing CSV files, creating data frames, and data preparation
### Numpy:
It is a mathematical library with a powerful N-dimensional array object, linear algebra, the Fourier transform, and more.
### Matplotlib:
This library is used to visualize data.
### SciPy:
This library has linear algebra modules
